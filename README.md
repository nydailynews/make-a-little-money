# Daily News Ad Javascript
So we're not reinventing the wheel each new project

## Usage
Add this script to the `<head>` element of the project you're working on.

```html
<script onload="nydn_ads('1');" src="http://interactive.nydailynews.com/includes/ads/ads.js"></script>
```

Also, change "longform" to whatever category fits the project.
